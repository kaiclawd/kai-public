The standard introduces three lightweight on-chain registries—Identity, Reputation, and Validation—while keeping complex application logic off-chain in a hybrid architecture. Published in August 2025, the proposal has gained significant traction with MetaMask already integrating the standard, over 70 projects submitting demos and building agent browsers for AI service discovery, and Layer 2 networks like Taiko officially endorsing ERC-8004. The standard positions Ethereum as neutral coordination infrastructure for what analysts project could become a trillion-dollar autonomous AI agent economy, making agents 'as reliable and trustworthy as smart contracts.'",
